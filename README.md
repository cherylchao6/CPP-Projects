# Each milestone I demonstrate my ability to:
### Milestone 1 (MS1):
- Organize source code into modules, using header and implementation files.
- Compile and link modular programs.
- Distinguish the contents of a header and an implementation file.

### Milestone 2 (MS2):
-  allocate and deallocated dynamic memory for an array and a single object
-  overload functions;
-  Use references;

### Milestone 3 (MS3):
- define class types
- privatize data within the class type
- use member functions to query the state of an object
- use member functions to change the state of an object

### Milestone 4 (MS4):
- The use of the default and overloaded constructors
- The use of destructors
- The use of the current object within the class's member functions
- The handling of dynamic resources via the constructor and destructor

### Milestone 5 (MS5):
- Define and create type conversion operators
- Define and create unary operators
- Define and create binary member operators
- Define and create helper functions
- Generate formatted output via cout

### Milestone 6 (MS6):
- Define and create copy constructors
- Define and create a copy assignment operator
- Prevent copying and assignment in a class
- Understand when and why to use friend classes  
- Do simple file IO using ifstream and ofstream

### Milestone 7 (MS7):
- inherit a derived class from a base class
- shadow a base class member function with a derived class member function
- access a shadowed member function that is defined in a base class
- utilize custom input/output operators with these classes

### Milestone 8 (MS8):
- define a pure virtual function
- code an abstract base class
- implement behavior declared in a pure virtual function
- explain the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class

### Milestone 9 (MS9):
- Apply the rule of three and its derived class.
- Use the concept of inheritance and polymorphism to reuse functionality of parent in child classes

### Milestone 10 (MS10):
- code a `struct` as template
- code function templates
- code calls to function template
