  What I learned the most during this workshop is definitely DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation).
At the beginning of the course, I had some difficulty grasping the concept, but when I actually
started writing code that involved DMA, I realized the importance of following the correct steps
when using pointers and how to dynamically allocate memory. Now, I am more proficient in 
understanding that I should initialize pointers as nullptr before using them. I also learned that
the 'new' operator returns an address, and it allocates memory based on the data type.

  During the assignment submission, I spent a considerable amount of time debugging to identify
any memory leaks. This helped me understand the importance of memory management and how to 
deallocate memory properly to avoid issues. Additionally, I learned about the process of designing
a small project, from setting up data structures to printing data, and finally deallocating memory.

  Furthermore, I gained a deeper understanding of how to correctly use the '&' operator for 
addresses. Overall, this workshop has been a valuable learning experience, and I feel more 
confident in my ability to work with dynamic memory allocation in C++.

  These concepts will undoubtedly be helpful in my future programming endeavors.
