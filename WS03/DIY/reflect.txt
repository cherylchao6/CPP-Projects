In this workshop, I have primarily learned the following key concepts:

  Constructing Classes and Understanding Class Properties: Previously, I was more accustomed 
to writing structs. However, through this workshop, I have become more proficient in building
classes from scratch. During the process, I even attempted to write my own constructor (icecream),
which I found to be remarkably convenient. Using a constructor eliminates the need for a separate 
"setEmpty()" function, and it ensures that every member inside the class has initial values upon 
creation. Additionally, I realized the significance of moving some member functions to the public
section when designing a class, which has deepened my understanding of how to decide which members
should be public and which should be private.

  Designing the Basic Structure of a Class: I now understand that when designing a class, it 
typically includes functions for setting values (set), getting values (get), setting to an empty
state (setEmpty), and, if dynamic memory allocation (DMA) is involved, a deallocate function to 
prevent memory leaks. The lab exercises provided valuable hands-on experience and guided me in 
completing my own DIY projects.

  Print Formatting: I spent a considerable amount of time contemplating how to format the order
summary output. Especially challenging was understanding how "cout.width" affects the next "cout"
statement, and ensuring that I unset the formatting after each line is printed. Now, I have a more
comprehensive understanding of how to format my data effectively.

  In summary, this workshop has enhanced my skills in class construction, taught me essential class
design principles, and improved my ability to format and present data accurately. These newfound 
insights will undoubtedly benefit me in my future programming endeavors.
