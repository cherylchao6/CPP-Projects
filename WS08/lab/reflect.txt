  Upon successful completion of this workshop, I have acquired a proficient understanding of 
fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. I have demonstrated the ability to define a 
pure virtual function, a crucial aspect of polymorphism in C++. By coding an abstract base class, 
I have comprehended the importance of abstraction in software design, allowing for the creation of 
generalized structures with defined interfaces.

  Furthermore, I have successfully implemented behavior declared in a pure virtual function, 
showcasing my ability to provide concrete functionality to abstract concepts. Through this process, 
I have gained insight into the practical application of inheritance and polymorphism, key principles
in object-oriented programming.

  Additionally, I have grasped the distinction between an abstract base class and a concrete class. 
While abstract base classes provide a blueprint for derived classes and cannot be instantiated on 
their own, concrete classes represent tangible objects that can be instantiated. Understanding this 
difference is essential for designing robust and scalable object-oriented systems.

  In conclusion, this workshop has provided me with valuable knowledge and skills in object-oriented
programming. By mastering the concepts of pure virtual functions, abstract base classes, and their 
practical implementations, I am better equipped to design and develop efficient and maintainable 
software solutions. Through reflection on this workshop, I have gained a deeper understanding of 
object-oriented programming principles and their significance in software development.
